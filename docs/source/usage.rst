**Using a String**:

You can start a string using double quotation marks like `"Hello!"`.

A way you can use this is by using the `print` command.

``print"Hello World";``


**Using a Function**:

Right now there is no way to use paramaters in a function.
You can use these examples to call a function.

``random();random();random();`` -- Prints 3 random numbers to console.

``random();random();random();halt();`` Same as above, but halts at the end.


**Commenting**:

Using a comment is as simple as writing 2 characters

***Note that you MUST put a ``;`` after your comment***

``// Hello! I am a comment!``
